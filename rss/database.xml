<title>Card Sorting</title>
<date>Sat, 12 Mar 2016 13:42:04 +0000</date>
<description>I went back to my users to help me decide which features would be the most important in the app and used the Card Sorting research technique to do this. Cards were printed out with 12 different possible app features on them. The users were asked to think about the features and rate in an&#8230; <a class="more-link" href="https://hazelwyllie.wordpress.com/2016/03/12/card-sorting/">More <span class="screen-reader-text">Card Sorting</span></a><img alt="" border="0" src="https://pixel.wp.com/b.gif?host=hazelwyllie.wordpress.com&#038;blog=82707613&#038;post=661&#038;subd=hazelwyllie&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" /></description>

<title>Mood Boards</title>
<date>Tue, 09 Feb 2016 13:24:42 +0000</date>
<description>I&#8217;ve been regularly updating &#8216;mood boards&#8217; as I move forward with this project. These boards actually help me think through common problems with the typical interface and remind me of how the more unusual devices come about.

<description>Inductive charging- chopped up a toothbrush because similar charging technologies. Wanted to look more in depth at the wireless transfer of energy. &#160; &#160; To put this in to context with the project, I moved on to hacking up some existing wireless chargers to see how they were wired up inside- component parts that were&#8230; <a class="more-link" href="https://ionabroadhurst.wordpress.com/2016/02/17/hickety-hackety/">Continue reading <span class="screen-reader-text">hickety-hackety</span> <span class="meta-nav">&#8594;</span></a><img alt="" border="0" src="https://pixel.wp.com/b.gif?host=ionabroadhurst.wordpress.com&#038;blog=88515887&#038;post=363&#038;subd=ionabroadhurst&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" /></description>

<title>Reporting button: inspiration and initial prototypes</title>
<date>Thu, 03 Mar 2016 19:54:05 +0000</date>
<description>Before starting sketching of the initial ideas for the reporting button, I looked into different elements that will have impact on the design. The types of handlebars used by cyclists can be narrowed down to four types: Cyclists-commuters usually use riser bars, while cyclists travelling longer distances usually have drop bars.

<date>Sun, 07 Feb 2016 19:52:29 +0000</date>
<description>I&#8217;ve been playing around with what form the physical kit will take. I&#8217;ve been working through form mostly using sketching and quick cardboard models before onto Solidworks. &#160; I drew up a number of ideas and made various forms before discussing them with classmates and also Chris.
